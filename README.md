# Palpatunes - Discord Music Bot
Setup Prerequisites:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Install pip: The package installer for Python. You can check if you have it installed by running pip --version. If not, install it.
Discord Account: Create a Discord account if you don't have one.
Discord Developer Portal: Create a new application on the Discord Developer Portal.

Create a Discord Bot:

In the Discord Developer Portal, create a new application.
Under the "Bot" tab, create a new bot and copy the token into the token variable.

Install Required Libraries:

Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this using pip:
pip install discord.py youtube-dl yt-dlp

Now if you have followed the instructions and run the code you should be able to play some music by typing '!play URL' where URL is the YouTube URL you wish to play.

Keep in mind this is a very basic bot and I plan to add more features later down the track.
